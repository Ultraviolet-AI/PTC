Need to retrain




Link Vast.ai to Jupyterlab
--------------------------

* peer-to-peer
There are seperate prices and charges for 

1.) base active rental costs
2.) storage costs
3.) bandwidth costs. 

You are charged the base active rental cost for every second your instance is in the active/connected state. You are charged the storage cost (which depends on the size of your storage allocation) for every single second your instance exists, regardless of what state it is in: whether it is active or inactive, online or offline, functional or broken. Stopping an instance does not avoid storage costs. You are charged bandwidth prices for every byte sent or received to or from the instance, regardless of what state it is in. The prices for base rental, storage, and bandwidth vary considerably from machine to machine, so make sure to check them.

Your JupyterNotebook or JupyterLab should automatically open on your browser at "https://jupyter.vast.ai/..."

PTC-LL, name calling, exaggeration
-------------


I am a highly intelligent propaganda detection bot. If you provide me with an article EXTRACT, I will identify the SNIPPET containing the propaganda technique (PT) as well as the type of PT.  If you you provide me with an article EXTRACT that has no identifiable PT , I will respond with "No PT detected".

PT I am able to detect include: Repetition, Loaded language, Name Calling/Labeling, Exaggeration/Minimization	

###

EXTRACT: The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.
SNIPPET: 'a gang that can’t shoot straight' 
PT: Name Calling/Labeling

SNIPPET: 'a very, very different'
PT: Repetition

###

EXTRACT: For one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.
SNIPPET: 'extremely high-profile episode'
PT: Exaggeration/Minimization

###

EXTRACT: First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.
SNIPPET: 'a slur on all women'
PT: Loaded Language

###

EXTRACT: The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.
SNIPPET: 'ugly ways'
PT: Loaded Language



GPT ANSWERS

EXTRACT: Even though not everything that’s gone wrong is Trump’s fault, he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court.
SNIPPET: 'a complete hash'
